Filter Task List

VCS_rough_draft_14 - Currently the cutoff for Matlab simulation
VCS_rough_draft_15 - start of C code implementation

NEED to set a complete task list, as the filter has had a lot of work on it, a list of items to the first full
version of the code should be possible.

With all future work, should try to keep as close to what will be running in the satellite as possible.  Once a set
of code is implemented, any changes that it would require to run on the satellite should be noted or coded in a
comment block.  With the implementation of a data gathering and processing module as noted below, the effect on how
the filter interacts with input should be non existant as the module is in place to seperate this interaction.
	-> Modularity is important to maintain for generality ,and error tracking.  Any task that performs some 
	type of major processing should be entered into its own function to be called from the main filter code.

Need to convert all double values to 32 bit integers, and modify any constants that take non milli values in.  The
inputs will have to be converted in alberts sim to units of milli or micro volts/watts/amps to and from the filter
	- The satellite works with and provides data in milli
	- Satellite uses 16 bit unsigned integers to store required data
	- Examples of data retrieval put the data at 5 digits

Data gathering and processing module
	- The filter is required to run every "tick" to gather data from the power board, and process the gathered
	data into compact data to be used in the filter.
	- This process is achieved by a seperate module that will request data, process it, and store it for use
	in the filter and as part of the information package that will be useful to report to ground.
	- The more information that can be reported the better, any processing of data on the satellite is 
	restricted to what the filter needs.  The rest of the data should be raw sets that can be sent to ground.

Build output structure for all testing output, this output will be reported from the satellite so build an actual
reporting tool rather than testing tools, can serve as both.
	- Need to report data process, all instantaneous versions of averages being taken in the data collection
	module, all collectable data could be useful including orbital data on power availability usage, the
	resultant data can be sorted through on the ground.
	- Need to report filter process.  The values of the main components contributing to the decision of power
	output, as well as the power estimation for each orbit.  Here the constants should be retrievable.
	-> After all information can be recovered from the satellite, Need to develop the ability to change constant
	values such as filter equaiton constants, converter efficiencies, and voltage definitions.

Design Review
	- Perform design review of the filter process exclusively.
	-> Compile a document on the entire filter, data gathering, and reporting tool.  Will include the filter
	design review, as well as the breakdown of the entire process.  This is at the least the start of the
	documentation for this power software module.
